CHUCK NORRIS FACTS

This is a project where I use the Chuck Norris Jokes (facts) generator API and return a random joke/fact.

I am using Vue.js in this project and practicing CSS styling.

8/5/2019 - Used v-html to wrap around currentJoke.joke in ChuckNorris.vue. This will make sure that we can see the actual quotes return from the json file from the API.

8/15/2019 - Used media queries to make the app more responsive on smaller devices. I am using Chrome tools to test and it seems to be working fine. I may want to tweak it later.
